# Integration of FastAPI with both MongoDB and MySQL enables interoperability between the two systems.

This README provides a brief overview of how to integrate and achieve interoperability between MongoDB and MySQL databases in a FastAPI application. Combining these two databases can offer flexibility and scalability for your data storage needs.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following components installed:

- Python (3.7 or higher)
- FastAPI
- PyMongo (Python driver for MongoDB)
- SQLAlchemy (Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping)
- Flask (used for the FastAPI app in this example)
- MongoDB server
- MySQL server

You can install Python dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install fastapi pymongo sqlalchemy flask
```

## Integration Steps

### 1. Setup MongoDB Connection

Replace `'mongodb://localhost:27017/'` with your MongoDB connection string and `'your_mongo_db_name'` with your desired MongoDB database name.

### 2. Setup MySQL Connection


Replace `'mysql://username:password@localhost/your_mysql_db_name'` with your MySQL connection string and database name.


## Conclusion

This README provides a basic outline of how to integrate MongoDB and MySQL in a FastAPI application. Depending on your project requirements, you may need to implement more complex logic and handling for data synchronization between the two databases. Always consider the specific needs of your application and design your database integration accordingly.
